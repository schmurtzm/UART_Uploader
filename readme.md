# UART Uploader - By Schmurtz

Script for easy upload files on linux devices which have only UART (=port com = serial connection)

It include a menu to guide the user and repeat actions quickly, it can be used as a command line utility.

The upload speed is pretty limited on serial : about 7kbit/s on 115200 serial connection (8 seconds for 50ko, 2 minutes for 1MB file).

## Download


The "normal" way to download sources on Github :

## How to use

** base64 binary is required on target device ! **

Usage:

__interactive mode :__

Run or double click on ```UART_Uploader``` -> You will have to enter your local file path, your folder destination on th remote device the COM port and the serial speed.
Everything is pretty easy thanks to a menu dedicated.

You can use drag and drop to select your source file or a file browser if you enter the command ff on the file selection menu.


__Command line mode :__

```UART_Uploader "file_path" "folder_destination" "com_port" "serial_speed" [/r] or [/s]```

            /r = 'run now' -> an upload will run immediately, 
	    		              you still have to press a key to close the upload Window
            /s = 'silent' : no user interction, upload window is automatically killed after 5 seconds



For help:    ```SerialSend /? ```

Example:     ```UART_Uploader.bat "MyBinary" "/tmp/target directory" COM3 115200 /r```


To automate multiple uploads you can create a .bat file :

```
UART_Uploader.bat "MyBinary_1" "/tmp" COM3 115200 /s
timeout 7
UART_Uploader.bat "MyBinary_2" "/tmp" COM3 115200 /s
```

#### How does it work ?
I was looking for a way to send files on linux device (Miyoo Mini console) which haven't network connection, only an UART port available.

The script will encode your source file in base64 and put it in a text file with some additional commands. Then this text file will be executed remotely with plink (a putty utility).


#### Alternative ways to upload a file on uart connection :

For a text file or a shell script, an easy way is to use vim (or nano if you're lucky) and copy paste inside. 

An alternative to upload text files is to use putty and cat command : 
 - type ```cat > somefile``` in putty
- copy/paste your text file in putty and hit Ctrl +D at the end

It's not very convenient and it doesn't works for binary files.

For binary files a way is to encode your source file in base64, send this base64 text file and then decode this file on the target device.
You will need base64 utility on both devices (one to encode and one to decode on the target device).
In case you don't have base64 utility on the target linux device, you could replace it by a script [like this one](https://gist.github.com/markusfisch/2648733).

#### Remarks & Futur Improvements :
- A difficulty is to know when plink has finished its upload. There's nothing easy to detect that. On my linux device I wasn't able to reset uart connection. So that's why I ask to the user to close plink himself when the upload is terminated.
- A similar script in shell for linux.
- A version of the script which support missing base64 binary on the target device [see here](https://gist.github.com/markusfisch/2648733).

 Some binaries for batch which are used in this script :
 - nircmd & nircmdc from nirsoft to manage windows.
 - EchoX from [Bill Stewart](https://westmesatech.com/?page_id=26) to add easily some colors in the menu
 - base64 from [DI Management](https://www.di-mgt.com.au/base64-for-windows.html) to encode in base64 on Windows
